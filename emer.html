    <h1 class="cent-p">Emerging Conflicts in Nepal</h1>
    <p class="content">
        Nepal is currently experiencing rising tensions due to political and social unrest. Recent protests in Kathmandu have highlighted growing dissatisfaction among various groups, including pro-monarch factions, teachers, medical students, and marginalized communities.
        <br><br>
        One major fault line in these conflicts is the resurgence of pro-monarchy movements, which have clashed with socialist alliances and Madheshi parties. Additionally, urban youths frustrated with the government’s performance are pushing for younger leadership and better governance.
        <br><br>
        Another source of unrest comes from disadvantaged socio-economic and ethnic groups, such as Madheshis, Janjatis, Dalits, and Muslims, who feel excluded from the promises of Nepal’s 2015 Constitution. These groups remain vocal about their concerns regarding inclusivity and dignity.
        <br><br>
        Foreign interests and geopolitical influences also play a role in shaping Nepal’s political landscape, with business houses and vested interest groups fueling public dissatisfaction.
